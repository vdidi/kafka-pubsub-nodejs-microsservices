Node.js REST APIs

Back-end Node.js aplication using Express framework and MongoDB

Step 1:
==

* Clone the repository:

```
https://github.com/vdidi/crud-nodejs-express-mongodb.git
```
* Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Step 2:
==

* I recommend you to install Postman to run the requests;
* Send a json to the api route. Example (post route):

```
{
  "nome" : "Name",
  "preco" : 100,
  "descricao" : "This is my description"
}
```
To run tests:
==

```
npm test

```
